## **Deep Flatten III**

### Objective

You need to flatten a deeply nested Object. The original Object given as input contains either nested Objects or primitive values.

### *Problem Statement*

Implement a flattenWith Prefix() function which will flatten the original Object into a new Object. This function will also take prefix' as an argument which will be a string denoting the representation of keys or properties to access the current value in the deeply nested object.

We use the dots"." notation in the prefix string between keys or properties to denote the representation of accessing a value in a deeply nested object.
