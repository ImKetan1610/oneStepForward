## Deep Flatten I

### Objective
You need to flatten a deeply nested array. The original array given as input contains either nested arrays or primitive values.

**_Problem Statement_**

Implement a 'flatten() function which will flatten the original array into a new array to the depth of arr given in the question. 'depth is any value up to which you need to flatten the deeply nested arrays in the original array.

`Note:` This problem is similar to the `Array.prototype.flat()` method. Where now we need to build our own version of `flat()`
